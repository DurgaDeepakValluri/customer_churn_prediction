## What Has Been Done

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Utilized the provided churn dataset for analysis.
- Cleaned the dataset:
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Encoded categorical variables to make the data machine-learning-ready.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Visualized customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn trends.
  - Gained insights into key factors influencing customer churn.

### 2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**
- Identified the most relevant features for predicting churn using feature selection techniques.
- Engineered additional features such as:
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
  - Usage patterns and trends.

### 3. **Model Building**
- Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure robust evaluation.
- Built multiple predictive models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting Models
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to optimize model performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated the performance of models using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC AUC
- Visualized results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- Analyzed feature importance to interpret the key drivers of customer churn.

### 5. **Deployment and Recommendations**
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
- Developed actionable recommendations for the telecom company, including:
  - Strategies for retaining high-risk customers.
  - Insights into key factors contributing to churn.

## Key Outcomes
- Built a predictive model capable of identifying high-risk churn customers with high accuracy.
- Provided clear, data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention.
- Delivered insights into customer behavior and characteristics, enabling informed business decisions.

---

## Next Steps
- Integrate the deployed model into real-time systems for proactive churn prevention.
- Continuously update and refine the model as new data becomes available.
- Explore additional customer engagement strategies based on model insights.
